We created the United Stories of America to inspire Thomas Cook customers to buy holidays to the USA. We developed an integrated digital campaign encouraging real people to celebrate their memories of America, or to tell us the US destinations they wish they could visit. The campaign centred around a Facebook app where fans could pin their wishes or memories to a map of the US for the chance to win a holiday. The campaign was rolled out across four European territories, and delivered 7k unique email addresses and 14k incredible user generated stories for Thomas Cook to use in their marketing material around United States holidays.
